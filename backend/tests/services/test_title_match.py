"""Different-album discriminator shared by the Usenet + Soulseek scorers.

``names_different_album`` keeps a request for one album from matching every OTHER album by
the same artist (the Led Zeppelin debut vs II/III/IV, Houses of the Holy, In Through the
Out Door...) - the failure that made the picker burn a download per wrong album and exhaust
before reaching the one requested. Cases below are drawn from real Newznab/Soulseek titles.

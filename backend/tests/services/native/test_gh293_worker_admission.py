"""GH-293 identity-worker admission tests.

Repair workers must yield their lease (requeue truthfully) under WAL
backpressure and after the 250 ms background timeslice, must wait for public
bootstrap demand, must never wait inside the scan safety gate, and must still
complete under sustained demand (forced-fairness progress floor).

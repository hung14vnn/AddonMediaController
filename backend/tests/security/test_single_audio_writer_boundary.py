"""Structural regression guard for the E10/E44 single-writer invariant.

E10 requires every audio mutation to funnel through the staged
``LibraryManagementPublisher`` chain, and E44 retains an explicit set of
user/admin removal features as the only non-staged filesystem writers outside
it. The identifier-absence checks in
``tests/services/native/test_library_management_mutation_boundary.py`` pin
retired names, but they cannot see a NEW writer under any fresh name: a scalar
mutator renamed tomorrow ships with zero resistance there.

These guards are structural (parsed ASTs, never greps - prose in a docstring
cannot read as code). Any new ``mutagen`` import, ``MutagenFile`` call, or
filesystem mutation primitive outside the sanctioned modules fails here, and
each allowlist doubles as living documentation of who owns that writer and
under which decision/gate.

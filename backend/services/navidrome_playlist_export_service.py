"""Export DroppedNeedle playlists as .m3u8 files for Navidrome to import.

Navidrome has no playlist write API but imports playlist files it finds while
scanning (``ND_PLAYLISTSPATH``, enabled by ``ND_AUTOIMPORTPLAYLISTS``). One-way:
Navidrome's own playlists are never read back.

The target directory is not exclusively ours, so ownership is proven by a marker
inside each file, a failed export keeps its previous file, and entries are
relative. No state is kept between runs.

"""Cost-control enforcement (CollectionManagement Feature C, D6/D8/D9/D11/D20).

Two distinct layers - deliberately NOT one choke point:

- **Layer 1, request-count quota, at submit.** A plain user's ask is recorded in
  ``request_history`` long before any download task exists, so the count gate runs
  where the ask is made: ``RequestService.request_album``/``request_batch``/
  ``request_track``. Exact tracks share the same approval gate as albums. Rolling
  window (D9); pending asks count.

- **Layer 2, byte caps, at every download-task-creation site.** The global library
  cap (all roles) and the per-user storage quota apply when bytes will actually be
  pulled: ``DownloadService.request_album`` (which ``request_track`` funnels into)
  AND the manual-pick path ``pick_candidate``. The requester's role is looked up by
  ``user_id`` here rather than threaded through the call sites.

``admin`` and ``trusted`` are exempt from the per-user quotas (D8); the global cap
applies to everyone; ``origin='upgrade'`` is exempt from all of it (an upgrade is
size-neutral: the old file is recycled). Caps block at/over and never evict (A3).

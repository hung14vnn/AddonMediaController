"""NowPlayingService - in-memory live presence registry.

Holds the current playing session for every source (the native web player, inbound
Subsonic/Jellyfin connected apps, and the polled upstream Jellyfin/Navidrome/Plex
servers) and broadcasts a privacy-projected snapshot over the SSE ``now-playing``
channel whenever it changes.

Single-process invariant: correct only under ``uvicorn --workers 1`` (the current
Dockerfile), like ``SSEPublisher``. Presence is transient and intentionally lost on
restart.

Privacy is enforced here, server-side, keyed on the **owner's** visibility setting,
so a hidden track is never serialized to other clients. A viewer always sees their
own track in full because the frontend overlays its own local player state - the
shared channel only ever carries other people's (projected) entries.

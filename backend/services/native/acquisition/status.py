"""Explicit download-task state (ArrRebuild step 5).

Lidarr reconstructs TrackedDownload state implicitly each poll; we make the states
explicit and typed. ``DownloadStatus`` is a ``StrEnum`` so each member IS its wire
string - it's drop-in everywhere the bare strings were used (DB column, SSE payloads,
the frontend contract are all byte-identical) while giving one typed source of truth.

The PERSISTED members are mirrored in the ``download_tasks.status`` CHECK constraint
(``infrastructure/persistence/download_store.py``); keep the two in sync. ``RETRYING`` /
``AWAITING_REVIEW`` are TRANSIENT UI signals published over SSE only - they are never
written to the DB, so they are deliberately NOT in the CHECK.

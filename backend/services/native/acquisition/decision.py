"""Decision vocabulary for the acquisition spec pipeline (ArrRebuild step 1).

A spec is a pure function ``(candidate, target, context, policy) -> Decision``.
``Decision`` is ``Accept | Reject``; ``Reject`` carries a typed ``code`` and a
``disposition`` that later steps map DIRECTLY onto failover/blocklist/retry
behaviour (design principle #3 - structured outcomes, not Lidarr's loose strings).

Nothing here does I/O or imports the API ``DownloadPolicySettings`` schema: this is
the vocabulary the pure specs speak, decoupled so they stay unit-testable with zero
mocks. The single I/O step (``DecisionContext`` / ``build_context``) lives in
``context.py``.

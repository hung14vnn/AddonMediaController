"""Source strategies (ArrRebuild step 4).

Each acquisition source (Soulseek via slskd, Usenet via Newznab+SABnzbd) differs in
search, identity, enqueue, poll→status, completed-file enumeration and cleanup. Lidarr
sprinkles ``if protocol == usenet`` across its download flow; we collapse those branches
behind a ``SourceStrategy`` so the orchestrator never branches on source. Source
enablement stays on the orchestrator (it reads the live enable toggles).

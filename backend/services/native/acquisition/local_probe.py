"""Unconditional LOCAL quality verification before publication.

Provider metadata is selection evidence, not truth (Acquisition plan): every
automatically acquired or manually picked audio file is probed through the
shared codec-aware metadata path BEFORE FileProcessor / Drop Import publishes
it. The probe never modifies audio and never writes around the Library
Management publisher/import path - it only reads tags through
``infrastructure.audio.tagger`` (the single sanctioned audio-writer boundary;
mutagen is importable ONLY there).

Facts derived here carry certainty ``exact`` with provenance ``local_probe``;
classification/comparison stays in :mod:`services.native.acquisition.quality`.

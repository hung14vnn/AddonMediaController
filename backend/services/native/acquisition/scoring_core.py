"""Pure token-matching core for acquisition scoring.

Stateless string helpers shared by the Soulseek album preflight scorer, the
per-track matcher, and plugin scoring (``PluginScoringHelper``). No engine
state, no stores, no models: every function takes plain ``str``/``float``
inputs so third-party plugins can score indexer/download candidates with the
exact same calibration as the native scorers.

Ownership: the low-level title discriminator (containment, artist evidence)
stays canonical in ``services.native.title_match``; this module owns the
normalisation + per-file confidence formula historically duplicated between
``album_preflight_scorer._file_confidence`` and ``track_matcher``.

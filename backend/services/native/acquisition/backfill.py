"""One-shot startup backfill: snapshot pre-existing acquisition rows.

Runs once per database (marker row ``acquisition_snapshot_backfill``), writing
the migration-time global policy as an origin=``legacy_migration``
AcquisitionQualitySnapshot onto every nonterminal native download task, every
search job that still lacks one (searching rows plus parked-review jobs linked
from those tasks), and every Free Music task. Later settings saves can never
mutate these stored blobs - restart-with-current-policy is the explicit
refresh. Reruns are no-ops: the marker short-circuits AND every UPDATE skips
rows already carrying a snapshot, so a crash mid-run converges on the next
startup instead of double-writing.

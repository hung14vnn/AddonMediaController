"""Shared album-title discriminator for the release scorers.

``token_set_ratio`` (the obfuscation-tolerant identity metric both scorers lean on)
IGNORES extra tokens, so a request scores near-identical against every *other* album by
the same artist: "Led Zeppelin" (the self-titled debut) ~= "Led Zeppelin II", "Houses of
the Holy", "In Through the Out Door"... A search for a popular artist returns the whole
discography, and without this guard the picker burns one full download per wrong album
(import matches 0 tracks -> blocklist -> failover) and exhausts before reaching the album
actually requested.

``names_different_album`` rejects a candidate that names a DIFFERENT album: one carrying
album-name words the requested title didn't ask for ("II", "houses", "presence"...). It is
used by both the Usenet (``NewznabReleaseScorer``) and Soulseek (``AlbumPreflightScorer``)
paths so the rule can't drift between them.

Design (validated against real Newznab/Soulseek result sets):
- The album name lives BEFORE the format/source/year run: ``Artist-Album-LP-FLAC-1969-GROUP``.
  We isolate the album region by truncating at the first format/quality boundary token, so
  the trailing scene group (REETKEVER, GP...) and the year never read as album words.
- A leading ``[002/113] "`` Usenet part-counter is stripped first - its digits would
  otherwise trip the boundary at position 0.
- Rejection is on EXTRA words only, never missing ones, so an obfuscated release of a
  numbered album still passes (Q4). And the whole guard is gated on the artist being
  present in the candidate: a fully obfuscated title (no readable artist) is left alone, to
  be settled by the indexer-match base score + the import tag-match (Q4 obfuscation tolerance).
- Version descriptors (deluxe/remaster/edition...) are stripped from BOTH sides, so a
  deluxe/remastered edition of the requested album still matches.
- Roman series numerals (II..) are ordinary alpha words, so they discriminate naturally.
  Digit volumes ("Vol. 2" vs "Vol. 3") are NOT distinguished: a bare digit can't be told
  from a year / bit-depth / catalog number, and ``volNN+NN`` par2 names would false-reject -
  the same scene-filename-collision caution that keeps ``part N`` out of the markers.

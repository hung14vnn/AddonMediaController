"""Two-phase album preflight scorer.

Group candidate files by ``(username, parent_directory)``, score folder
coherence, then rank by identity (coherence + per-file confidence) alone; peer
availability (free slot / queue depth / speed) is a banded tiebreaker that can never buy
acceptance, and ``tier='auto'`` additionally requires the requested artist to be
named somewhere in the folder's remote paths (D2/D3, 2026-07-05 incident).

Below-threshold groups are kept (``tier='rejected'``, top ~50 by score) so the
Review tab's "Show all results anyway" needs no re-search. Quarantined
``(username, filename)`` sources are dropped before scoring. Non-audio sidecars
(cover art, cue, log, m3u) a folder search returns are excluded before judging - a
quality gate then drops folders whose audio is outside ``quality_min``..``quality_max``
or, when ``flac_mp3_only``, contains a non-FLAC/MP3 track. Acceptance tier and identity
band precede quality, so a weak hi-res folder cannot hide a safe standard-lossless match.
CJK strings skip ``unidecode``; off-version matches (remix/live/acoustic vs
original) are penalised x0.3.

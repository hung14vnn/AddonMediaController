"""Case-insensitive path routing for the compat shims.

Real Jellyfin (ASP.NET Core) and many Subsonic servers route paths
case-insensitively and some clients rely on it (Feishin POSTs
``/jellyfin/users/authenticatebyname``), but FastAPI matches case-sensitively, so
this canonicalises ``/subsonic`` / ``/jellyfin`` paths to the route's registered
casing before routing. Reconstruction from ``path_format`` is lossless because
every compat path param is a hex/uuid id, an int, or an already-lowercased value.

Must sit OUTSIDE the rate-limit middleware so its exact-path check sees the
canonical form.

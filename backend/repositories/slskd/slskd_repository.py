"""``SlskdRepository`` - the only v1 ``DownloadClientProtocol`` implementation.

Owns the search and enqueue semaphores (both 1; slskd permits only one
concurrent search and one concurrent enqueue, C3) and translates slskd JSON
shapes to/from the protocol types. slskd has NO batch id: a task is correlated
to its transfers by ``TaskHandle(source="soulseek", username, filenames)`` (C2).

Implements the download side of the split protocol (D2). The search side is
re-homed onto ``SlskdIndexer`` (an ``IndexerProtocol`` adapter wrapping this
repo's ``search_album``/``search_track``), so those two methods stay here but are
no longer part of ``DownloadClientProtocol``.

Does NOT use ``from __future__ import annotations`` so its method signatures
stay structurally identical to the protocol for the conformance contract test.

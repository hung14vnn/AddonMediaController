"""Pluggable indexer (search) contract - the search half of the split (D2).

Search and download are separate systems for Usenet, so the old fused
``DownloadClientProtocol`` is split: this module owns *search → releases*, and
``download_client.py`` owns *acquire → track → locate*. slskd satisfies the
search side via a thin ``SlskdIndexer`` adapter; Newznab satisfies it natively.

``IndexerResult`` is a tagged union so one protocol return type spans both
sources without forcing a ``Release`` supertype (D7): the orchestrator unwraps
by ``source`` and routes to the matching scorer, leaving the existing
``DownloadSearchResult`` and the existing scorers byte-for-byte unchanged.

Does NOT use ``from __future__ import annotations``: the conformance contract
test compares ``inspect.signature`` (including return annotations) across impls,
so annotations here and in every implementation must be real objects, not
strings, and identical.
